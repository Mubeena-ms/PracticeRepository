            <P>Tigers have reddish-orange coats with prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears. 
                Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. 
                Because of this, researchers can use stripe patterns to identify different individuals when studying 
                tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies.
                They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest
                tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, 
                without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.
